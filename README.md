## :tada: Overview
<br/>

A modern JavaScript starter toolkit for web-development using Gulp task runner and Webpack bundler. 
  
Ideal for fast building static HTML sites or templates. It speeds up the proccess of delevelopment, 
testing and deploy in a front-end project. Also it can be extended in a simple way when project 
require some extra functionality provided by thirdparty packages.
  
All the tasks are done via Gulp. Webpack is just used for Javascript (especially for ES6 
Import/Export as Gulp can't do it in a proper way) and not for rest because it's a little bit 
overhed to translate all static assets and styles through js using Webpack.
